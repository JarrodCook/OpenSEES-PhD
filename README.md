# OpenSEES-PhD
A two-dimensional flexible rocking frame model was created using OpenSEES software [OpenSEES
2007] and an overview is presented in Figure 7.1. The purpose of the model is to provide a
computationally inexpensive, yet suitable approximation of the response of a flexible rocking frame
when exposed to a range of ground motion recordings. This model allows for the examination of the
effects of the Grip 'n' Grab device on structure response and the capacity requirements for the device
to operate correctly for the duration of an earthquake event.

The flexible rocking model developed is based on the assumption of point to point rocking about the
two outer edges of the frame. Effectively the rocking interface is assumed to have some flexibility, but
the locations of the rocking pivots are fixed. This is expected to be a suitable simplification in the case
of steel frames, where the frames are constructed to avoid significant deformation of the shape of the
structure near the rocking edges, and where suitable horizontal supports are provided. The central
element at the base of the frame model represents the post tensioning.

The model incorporates elements to simulate the behaviour of the rocking frame, GNG-dissipater
systems and post-tensioning elements, with appropriate vertical and horizontal masses. A leaning
column is included to model the seismic mass of the main structure connected to the rocking frame.
The mass of the leaning column is modelled at the same height as the frame mass, as implemented in
similar rocking studies [Hall et al. 2010, Wiebe 2013]. The rocking mechanism and the behaviour at
the base of the frame was the focus of the model. Therefore, the form of the rocking frame itself was
kept simple. While higher mode effects could be considered, the influence of higher modes is expected
to have limited influence on the base rotation and the required capacity of the GNG dissipative
element.
