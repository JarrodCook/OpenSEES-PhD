Grab Ratcheting, Tension-only Devices for Seismic Energy Dissipation Systems"*

## Thesis Abstract

This thesis details the development of a ratcheting, tension-only mechanism for use with seismic
energy dissipation systems, known as the Grip 'n' Grab (GNG). The development is taken from initial
design concepts through to construction and testing of two prototype devices, as well as development
of a material model algorithm to simulate the hysteretic response of the devices, and a finite element
flexible rocking system model to assess the behaviour of a controlled rocking system instrumented
with the GNG device. The GNG devices developed use single direction engagement to provide
resistance to system displacements while allowing for re-centring and closure of rocking joints.
Concerns around buckling and residual compressive forces in the dissipater, which can exist in
traditional tension-compression solutions are ameliorated. The ratcheting mechanism reduces the
take-up prior to engagement on cycles after previous engagement of the dissipater element has
occurred, increasing resistance to displacement and improving energy dissipation capability.

The completed schedule of monotonic compressive and cyclic experiments, with 14 yielding steel
dissipaters, has provided insight into operational issues and design considerations. Careful detailed
design was used in both prototypes to ensure a low-cost and easy to machine device, to increase
likelihood of uptake. The results of the testing of the two prototype devices, and the subsequent
numerical analyses, show the potential of the GnG concept to be a favourable option in supplementary
damping and bracing systems. Robust, repeatable operation of both prototype mechanisms, with
redundancy in engagement, was observed, with negligible compressive forces recorded. The GNG
ratcheting, tension-only devices developed provide a unique solution which can be implemented with
a range of energy dissipation mechanisms as desired. The ratcheting mechanism itself is generalisable
and could be attached to the dissipater element through a range of interfaces, depending on what is
required for a given application.

The GNG material model algorithm developed allowed for the device behaviour to be simulated in
numerical analysis, providing a basis for the inclusion of a GNG device within a structural design. The
finite element controlled rocking system model also developed in this thesis was used to simulate the
behaviour of a rocking frame and provide insight into GNG behaviour in a rocking structure and the
impact on the overall behaviour of the controlled rocking system. Multiple parameter studies were
conducted involving over 18000 individual time-history analyses looking at the response of a range of
structures to a ULS seismic event based in the Wellington region. The study of rocking system response
and demand in the GNG devices completed in this thesis provides a tentative guide for
implementation and required capacity in deployment.
