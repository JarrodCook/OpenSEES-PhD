# New hysteretic material model

I wrote a new custom hysteretic material model algorithm to simulate the behaviour of the novel GNG devices, and added this contribution to the OpenSEES source code.

This folder contains the header file *GNGMaterial.h* and the main file *GNGMaterial.cpp* that were added to the OpenSEES source code. Both files were edited from a
temple / example of the appropriate OpenSEES file format. Also included is a basic description of how to use the new material model *GNGMaterialWiki.pdf*.
